 LITERATURE SURVEY
2.1TITLE: Existing methods using AR to enhance creativity
AUTHOR: Zhengya Gong and Georgi V. Georgiev PUBLICATION YEAR: 2020
Augmented reality (AR) technology has introduced a range of equipment, contexts, and stimuli with possible applications in the context of design creativity. In response, recent studies have investigated AR as a tool that can be applied to enhance creativity. As a part of such research, this paper reviews existing studies and provides a state-of-the-art literature review based on the componential theory of creativity. Based on studies that investigate the use AR to enhance creativity, we found that AR can be used to improve specific factors to enhance creativity, and a natural environment can be considered a positive factor for enhancing creativity. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis that AR technology could be a useful method to simulate nature for enhancing creativity; experimentation based on the hypothesis is expected to be conducted in the future.

AUTHOR: John M. Jones , Reyhan Duezguen , Peter Mayer , Melanie Volkamer , Sanchari Das
PUBLICATION YEAR: 2020
As virtual reality (VR) sees an increase in use in several domains such as retail, education, military; a secure authentication scheme for AR devices is necessary to keep users’ personal information safe. A smaller section of research focuses on the authentication schemes of AR devices. To further the understanding of this topic, we conducted a detailed literature review of AR authentication by exploring papers published till October 2020. A total of N = 29 papers were found. While many papers evaluate the accuracy of authentication methods, few conduct detailed user studies. In the user studies done, we found a lack of focus on diverse populations such as the elderly, with the mean age of the participants being
25.11. Our findings from the literature review give a detailed overview of VR-based authentication schemes and highlight trends as well as current research gaps. These findings drive future research direction to create robust and usable authentication strategies.

Despite the growing interest and discussions on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in tourism, we do not yet know systematically the knowledge that has been built from academic papers on VR and AR in tourism; if and how VR and AR research intersect, the methodologies used to

research VR and AR in tourism, and the emerging contexts in which VR and AR have surfaced in tourism research. By conducting a systematic literature review on VR/AR research in tourism, this work seeks to answer five main research questions: (1) Which tourism sectors and contexts have VR and AR research emerged in?; (2) Which forms of VR and AR have garnered the most attention in tourism research?; (3 and 4) What methodologies/theories are being utilized to research VR and AR in tourism?; and (5) What are the research gaps in VR and AR tourism research? From a synthesis of 46 manuscripts, marketing and tourism education emerged as the most common contexts. However, issues with heterogeneity appeared in terminology usage alongside a lack of theory-based research in VR and AR. Also, gaps were identified where challenges identified revolved around awareness of the technology, usability, and time commitment.
